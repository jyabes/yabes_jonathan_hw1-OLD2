# TRAVEL: 

I love to travel and have visited 11 countries, Maldives, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Barcelona, Portugal, Vienna and now in Canada but I am here to study. Cheers!

Me and my wife love Maldives beacause for its natural beauty and romantic atmosphere. We enjoyed a variety of activities, from snorkeling and diving to fishing and island-hopping as well as romantic sunset. Maldives is perfect destination for couples and relax in a beautiful and peaceful setting.
