# ABOUT ME:

I am Jonathan, and I am from Philippines. I am happily married with two lovely kids aged 8 and 6. They both love arts and singing. I play golf and have been playing the sport for over 10 years. I have competed in many tournaments, both regionally and nationally, and have won several awards. I specialize in driving accuracy and have been working to refine my short game. I am always looking for new techniques and strategies to improve my game.
